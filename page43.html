    <p class="clue">
        My first letter begins each Mexican's name,<br>
        My second, 'you're adorable' sings Crock the Dame.<br>
        Now add the first letter of Bert's alias,<br>
        And the second of the clothing the Inspector has.<br>
        <br>
        The number of aces Lucretia tells to her crew,<br>
        And the place in the rainbow of Lancelot's hue.<br>
        <br>
        Crusher's note 12th higher than G,<br>
        And the letter that won't be said by Kylie.<br>
