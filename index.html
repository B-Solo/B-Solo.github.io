        Welcome to the HCTG Turn Your Radio On Treasure Hunt! <br>
        <br>
        Solving the clues on this website will lead you to locations around the theatre. If you're in the right place, you'll find a QR code to a website with the next clue! <br>
        <br>
        The clues will be changed to get easier as the days go on to help people who get stuck! <br>
        <br>
        The first three countries that solve the final puzzle at the end win the medals - so work together with your teammates, share the websites/clues, and discuss with each other!<br>
        <br>
        Your first clue is hidden somewhere on this page...<br>
        <br>
        Good luck!
